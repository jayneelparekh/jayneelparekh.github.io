<!-- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/jparekh/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --> 

Hi there! I have started a Postdoc in MLIA team at ISIR, Sorbonne Univerity with [Prof. Matthieu Cord](https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/). Previously, I was a PhD student at LTCI, Telecom Paris under the supervision of [Prof. Florence d'Alche](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/) and [Prof. Pavlo Mozharovskyi](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/mozharovskyi/), on the topic of interpretability of neural networks, applied on image or audio data. I completed my bachelors and masters in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. For my master's thesis, I worked with [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/prao) and [Prof. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yang/) on Speech-to-Singing conversion.

Broadly, I am interested by machine learning applications on audio and visual domains. Barring research, I enjoy playing/involving myself with chess, squash, calisthenics or following sports (primarily football, boxing, cricket).
